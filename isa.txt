[Rs] - "The memory at Rs"

Base instruction set:
    ADD		RD, RS	add registers RD+RS, store the result in RD
    SUB		RD, RS	subtract registers RD-RS, store the result in RD
    LOAD	RD,[RS]	load 1 byte from memory at address RS into RD
    STORE	RD,[RS]	store 1 byte from RD into memory at address RS
    SKIPNZ	RD		if RD!=0, skip the next instruction
    SKIPZ	RD		if RD==0, skip the next instruction
    JALR	RD,RS	save PC+1 into RD, jump to RS
    SLI		RD, IMM	shift the lower four bits of RD into the upper four bits, then load 4-			bit IMM into the lower four bits of RD 
    HALT			stops the processor

extended instruction set:
	NAND	RD,RS	computes bitwise nand ~(RD&RS), result in RD
	IN		RD		waits for user to enter input and puts it in RD
	OUT		RD		prints RD to the console
	INC		RD		adds one to RD
	DEC		RD		subtracts one from RD
	NOP				do nothing
